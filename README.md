  It was interesting that I can modify github files through VS code (development environment). I'm excited to learn more about this.

  # Elevator pitch
  Somedays, it is difficult for me to pick what to eat for lunch/dinner. There are so many categories to choose. It could be 
  chinese, korean, japanese, western food, 
  spicy or non spicy,
  bread, rice, noodles,
  hot or cold, etc.
  We can choose by voting with friends,
  or by checking trending food ranks from other delivery apps,
  or by relying on random pick from the app.
